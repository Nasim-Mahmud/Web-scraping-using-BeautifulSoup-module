# Web-scraping-using-BeautifulSoup-module

<p>We can gather data from HTML or XML files with the help of the Python module called <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful Soup</a>. For this project, I scraped the top 100 films ever made from the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_100&sort=user_rating,desc">IMDB</a> website and put them in a text file.
